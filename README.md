# Facebook Conversion API for Unbounce

We've created Google Tag Manager web and server container templates that you can use for setting up Facebook conversion API for Unbounce landing pages. 
You can merge these GTM templates with your existing GTM containers. 
This setup will send page_view and lead events to Facebook from the browser and server with deduplication enabled. 
We will send user email, first name, last name, and phone number for lead events.
